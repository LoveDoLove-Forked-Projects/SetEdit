The open source version of 4A Settings Database Editor.

WARNING -- I do not guarantee that problems caused by the improper use of this utility can be fixed, and we are unable to help you with any such problems. We support only this app, not your device's system software. Settings Database Editor (SetEdit) is invaluable if you need it, but if you're not careful you're very likely to mess something up.

By default, for your protection, Android prevents you from modifying the SECURE and GLOBAL tables. If you have Android Jellybean or later, you can remove this protection from an ADB shell using the command "pm grant io.github.muntashirakon.setedit android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS". On earlier versions, you can only remove this protection on a rooted device by installing SetEdit to the system partition.

Both WRITE_SETTINGS and WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permissions are optional if you do not need to edit any items.

This app needs to target API 22 because API 23 (Android M) onwards do not allow it to modify some setting items without elevated permissions such as root or ADB.

In Android 14 onwards, a new restriction has been added that prevents an app targeting API 22 or earlier to be installed without elevated permission.
You can install the application from an ADB shell using the following command:

adb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk

Or, from a rooted shell:

pm install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk

(Replace `SetEdit.apk` with the actual file name or location.)
